# BGS Groundhog

## Introduction

We all believe that a safe, sustainable and well-understood environment
that makes best use of new and existing resources is a cornerstone of
progress.

From the management and use of natural resources to the safe creation,
regeneration and maintenance of the built environment, we understand
that high-quality site investigation coupled with conceptual geological
understanding is key. Software that enables you to interpret your data,
create models and communicate risks and insights can take things to the
next level, but such digital tools are often complex, highly specialised
and costly.

That\'s why we\'re developing **Groundhog Desktop**

We believe that you should have access to geological software which is
powerful, without it being complicated or expensive. Our software is
available in both no-cost \"Community\" and low-cost \"Professional\"
editions. With Groundhog, our mission is to provide you with a simple,
effective way of visualising and interpreting site data as well as
developing conceptual and 3D digital geological models.

To get started with the no-cost Community Edition of our software,
please go to the [BGS site](https://www.bgs.ac.uk/groundhog)
