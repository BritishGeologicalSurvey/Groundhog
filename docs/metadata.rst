Providing Metadata
===================

Unstructured data
------------------

Unstructured data includes reports and documents in PDF format. 

Create metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The best solution will be that the users in the different project can make their PDF-files ready using MSOffice or LibreOffice with at least the basic metadata in the document. The document is then exported to PDF. 

1.	The PDF is uploaded
2.	The user are shown the metadata from the PDF
3.	The user if needed can add new metadata by selecting the metadata type from a list and typing in the value or to change the metadata entries from the PDF
4.	The user check a checkbox stating that the document can be released to the public
5.	The user hit a “Save” button
6.	The PDF are updated with the new metadata elements (using Andrej’s tool) and moved to the document repository. At the same time the metadata is written into an EGDI metadata table
