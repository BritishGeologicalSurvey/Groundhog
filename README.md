## Introduction

**We all believe that a safe, sustainable and well-understood environment that makes best use of new and existing resources is a cornerstone of progress.**

From the management and use of natural resources to the safe creation, regeneration and maintenance of the built environment, we understand that high-quality site investigation coupled with conceptual geological understanding is key. Software that enables you to interpret your data, create models and communicate risks and insights can take things to the next level, but such digital tools are often complex, highly specialised and costly.

**That's why we're developing Groundhog Desktop**

We believe that you should have access to geological software which is powerful, without it being complicated or expensive. Our software is available in both no-cost "Community" and low-cost "Professional" editions. With Groundhog, our mission is to provide you with a simple, effective way of visualising and interpreting site data as well as developing conceptual and 3D digital geological models.

To get started with the no-cost Community Edition of our software, please go to https://www.bgs.ac.uk/groundhog 

For Groundhog Professional license keys and trials please visit LQM - https://www.lqm.co.uk/csm

## System Requirements
Windows 7 or above (64-bit). Mouse with scroll wheel (laptop trackpad NOT recommended).
Dedicated graphics card recommended for optimium 3D graphics performance. May not function over network, virtual or
remote-desktop type deployment platforms. Admin rights likely to be required during installation. Please ensure correct operation
with your local IT administrator using a trial license to ensure satisfactory performance with your local IT policies.

## Groundhog Community

Totally free-to-use, forever.

Download Groundhog Community and get started right away, at no cost, using the Open Government License.

Use the rich features of Groundhog Community on all of your projects, including commercial work.

### Boreholes

If you’ve been looking for a simple way to explore and present your borehole data then Groundhog is for you!

Import site borehole data from a range of formats (TXT, CSV, AGS) or enter it directly in Groundhog.

Easily create customised borehole log report templates and share them with other Groundhog users.

Explore your in-situ and lab test data with the built-in support for AGS 3.1 and 4.

Visualise composite geophysical logs using the LAS importer.

### Cross-Sections

We understand that the humble cross-section remains a valuable tool for interpretation and conceptualisation.

Construct detailed geological cross-sections, to scale, using the simple drawing tools.

Import site elevation grids, or use the built-in 250m UK OS Open DTM, to automatically generate topographic elevation profiles.

Import and display images such as geophysical proles or conceptual sketches. 

Include or buffer boreholes into the cross-section and display using any log template.

### Maps

You know where you are with a map.

Display and edit your own data layers and control their appearance. Display BGS Web Map Services and perform map-unit identify queries.

Hyperlink to borehole scans on the BGS website.

Download AGS records directly from the BGS web service.

### 3D Graphics 

Visualise your data in a new dimension with the first version of Groundhog to include 3D graphics!

## Groundhog Professional

Express your conceptual understanding using our low-cost solution for modelling work. Developed with LQM, Groundhog Professional has all the features of Community with added support for both conceptual site modelling and 3D geological model building.

Trials and digital license keys for Groundhog Professional are available through LQM. 

www.lqm.co.uk

### Conceptual Site Models

Developed closely with industry leaders Land Quality Management (LQM). 

Add labels, call-outs, arrows and water levels.

Integrate geology into the CSM and include key site features using the in-built library of graphical objects.

Define contaminants, sources, pathways and receptors in the data model and construct contaminant linkages and network diagrams.

### 3D Geological Modelling

Dynamic, implict modelling directly from data inputs including boreholes, points, linework, cross-sections, structure contours or thickness, depth and elevation values.

**The only interpolation engine geared to rapid modelling of shallow and Quaternary deposits.**
